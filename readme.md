Anything that let's me transform an idea into code is great, including Python and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.

But....as I code the larger version 3 of my project, the logic of the advantages behind OOP -- for my project anyway -- does not really hold up.

A programmer does not have enough working memories in his/her brain to handle the many names, classes, inheritance structure, etc of a large project such as the one I am working on.



A programming paradigm should take into account human 'memory bandwidth'.

Work of Hermann Ebbinghaus -- learning and forgetting curves (1885) and work of
George Miller "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two" (1956) makes us aware of the
fragility of human working memory, and the limited resource we have there in processing
new stimuli.

Replace OOP (Object Oriented Programming) with HOP (Human Oriented Programming).

-Must minimize anything that taxes the very limited human working memory.

-This also allows better maintenance by humans with same limited working memory.

-Avoid short variable names but try to use names which allow reader to follow what the variable represents

-Use any sort of database, NOT inheritance, to code relationships

-From point of view of human memory -- DRY (do not repeat yourself) can be good at times

-Ok to allow many and changing variables to participate in an action and share data
 as long as all is working-memory friendly

-All functions must have built-in unit tests, reflecting weaknesses of human working-memory in evaluating code behavior, even in small decomposed functions
