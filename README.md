Classless but Ebbinghaus-polite Python Coding


#
#HOP (Human Oriented Programming)

#--------------------------------
#
#pragma ebbinghaus=7
#
#Goal is to automatically reconfigure code to Ebbinghaus/Miller number the reader feels comfortable with.

#HOP goal is to account for the human's abilities and provide the paradigm and human memory loading that works best for the human reader/programmer rather than a rigid OOP approach.

#HOP (Human Oriented Programming) should not be confused with Role Oriented Programming -- we don't look for vague ways humans do things (ie, as "roles") but are directly concerned with neurophysiological bandwidth and working-memory processing abilities of human reader/programmer.
